# Cursor AI Rules for Serger Project

## Project Overview
Serger is a Python module stitcher that combines multiple source files into a single executable script.

## Key Conventions

### Code Quality
- **Line length**: Maximum 88 characters (enforced by Ruff)
- **Python version**: Target Python 3.10+ compatibility
- **Type checking**: Strict Pyright/Pylance + Mypy compliance required
- **Linting**: All code must pass `poetry run poe check:fix`

### Execution
- Always use `poetry run python3` (not bare `python3`) to ensure execution in the project's virtual environment
- Use `poetry run poe` tasks for all common operations (see pyproject.toml)

### Important Files
- `dist/serger.py` is **generated** - never edit directly
- Generate it using `poetry run poe build:script`
- `dist/` contains build outputs - do not edit

### Project Structure
- `src/serger/` - Main source code
- `tests/` - Test suite
- `dev/` - Development scripts

### Git Commit Conventions
- NEVER include AI tool attribution or Co-Authored-By trailers in commit messages
- Write clean, conventional commit messages

## Development Workflow
1. Make changes to source files in `src/serger/`
2. Run `poetry run poe check:fix` before committing
3. Run `poetry run poe build:script` to regenerate `dist/serger.py` if needed
4. Run `poetry run poe test` to verify changes
