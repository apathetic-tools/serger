### Execution and Workflow
- Always use `poetry run python3` (not bare `python3`) to ensure execution in the project's virtual environment
- **Use poe tasks** for all common operations:
  - `poetry run poe check` - Run linting, type checking, and tests
  - `poetry run poe fix` - Auto-format and fix linting issues
  - `poetry run poe test` - Run test suite
  - `poetry run poe coverage` - Generate code coverage report (dual runtime coverage)
  - `poetry run poe check:fix` - Fix, type check, and test (run before committing)
  - `poetry run poe build:script` - Generate the single-file dist/serger.py
  - `poetry run poe sync:ai:guidance` - Sync AI guidance files from `.ai/` to `.cursor/` and `.claude/`
- **When modifying `.ai/` files**: After changing any file in `.ai/rules/` or `.ai/commands/`, you **must**:
  1. Run `poetry run poe sync:ai:guidance` to sync changes to `.cursor/` and `.claude/`
  2. Include the generated files (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.cursor/commands/*.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`) as part of the same changeset/commit
- **Before committing**: Run `poetry run poe check:fix` (this also regenerates `dist/serger.py` as needed)
