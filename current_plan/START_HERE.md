# Start Here: Module Actions Implementation

**Next iteration**: Iteration 09 - `current_plan/09_integrate_mode_to_actions.md`

**Context**:
- See `current_plan/00_overview.md` for overall strategy and principles
- See `current_plan/plan_module_actions_design.md` for complete design reference
- See `current_plan/coverage_validation.md` to verify all features are covered
- See `current_plan/03.5_resolve_clarifying_questions.md` for key decisions

**Important principles**:
- Each iteration must pass `poetry run poe check:fix` before committing
- Follow the iteration file exactly - it has all the details
- Preserve code that will be needed later, even if not called yet
- Add unit tests for each section as we go
- **Review at end of iteration** - document any clarifying questions before proceeding

**Completed**: Iterations 01, 02, 03, 03.5, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08 ✓
