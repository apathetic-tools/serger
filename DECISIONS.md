# DECISIONS.md

A record of major design and implementation decisions in **serger** — what was considered, what was chosen, and why.

Each entry should be:

- **Atomic:** one key decision per entry.
- **Dated:** include the date you made the call.
- **Rationale-focused:** emphasize _why_ something was done (or not done), not just _what_.

## Choose `libcst` for Single-File Builds<small> —  2025-10-13

### Context

`serger` needs a **self-contained single-file** form for users who want to download and run it directly, without installation.  

The previous approach — a hand-built regex concatenator (`src/serger/make_script.py`) — broke often due to regex-based import parsing and syntax quirks.  

We wanted a **syntax-aware**, low-maintenance bundler that kept the output **human-readable**.

### Options Considered

All these tools unless marked will merge several `.py` files (sometimes even a complete module) into a single `.py` file of valid python that behaves in the same way.

| Tool | Pros | Cons | Note |
|------|------|------|------|
| **Custom script (current regex based)** | ✅ Full control<br>✅ Easy to inject metadata<br>✅ Minimal deps | ❌ Fragile with multiline imports<br/>❌ Regex-based parsing is unreliable<br>❌ Hard to maintain |
| **Custom script (AST Based)**<br/>`ast.parse()` or `libcst` | ✅ Full control<br>✅ Easy to inject metadata<br>✅ Minimal deps | ❌ Complex tool to develop and maintain<br>❌Distracts resources from main project
| ~~**[`pinliner`](https://pypi.org/project/pinliner/)**~~| ✅ Preserves internal imports<br>✅ Keeps code readable<br>✅ Syntax-aware |❌ No longer maintained (~7 years)<br>❌Does not work on Python 3.12+<br>❌ Adds a small runtime import shim<br>❌ Slightly more complex than plain concatenation | Attempted won't run on 3.12+ |
| ~~**[`pinliner city fork`](https://github.com/The-city-not-present/pinliner)**~~ | ✅ Works on Python 3.12<br>✅ Same as pinliner | ❌ Not actively maintained (~9 months)<br>❌ Fixed just enough to work<br>❌ Same as Pinliner | Attempted, hangs tests,<br> back to regex duct tape |
| **[`compyner`](https://pypi.org/project/compyner/)** | ✅ Lightweight<br>✅ Flat, readable output<br>✅ Works recursively through imports | ❌ Targeted at MicroPython<br>❌ Limited testing<br>❌ Loses *import* semantics |
| **[`PyBreeder`](https://github.com/pagekite/PyBreeder)** | ✅ Simple concatenator<br>✅ Minimal dependencies | ❌ No longer maintained (~5 years)<br>❌ Targets Python 2.x<br>❌ Not syntax-aware<br>❌ Breaks easily on complex imports or formatting<br>❌ No license |
| **[`PyBake`](https://pypi.org/project/pybake/)** | ✅ Can bundle code *and* data with embedded filesystem | ❌ No longer maintained (~4 years)<br>❌ Early stage Python 3.x migration<br>❌ Heavier than needed for pure code<br>❌ Not meant for source-level readability |
| **[`pybundler`](https://pypi.org/project/pybundler/)** | ✅ Preserves importable package structure<br>✅ Great for dual CLI/library tools | ❌ No longer maintained (~6 years)<br>❌ Adds ~100 lines bootstrap<br>❌ May be overkill for CLI |
| **Executable bundlers**<br> ([`zipapp`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html), [`shiv`](https://pypi.org/project/shiv/), [`pex`](https://pypi.org/project/pex/), [`PyInstaller`](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)) | ✅ Ideal for binary-like releases or hermetic CI packaging<br>✅ Well-supported and production-grade | ❌ Produce `.pyz` or binaries (not plain Python)<br>❌ Not human-readable<br>❌ Can have larger artifact size |

### Code sample with `libcst`

```python
import libcst as cst
import os

modules = ["types.py", "utils.py", "config.py", "build.py", "cli.py"]
imports, bodies = [], []

for mod in modules:
    tree = cst.parse_module(open(os.path.join("src/server", mod)).read())
    for stmt in tree.body:
        if isinstance(stmt, (cst.Import, cst.ImportFrom)):
            if "server" not in stmt.code:
                imports.append(stmt.code)
        else:
            bodies.append(stmt.code)

with open("bin/server.py", "w") as f:
    f.write("#!/usr/bin/env python3\n")
    f.write("\n".join(sorted(set(imports))) + "\n\n")
    for body in bodies:
        f.write(body + "\n")
```

### Decision

Attempt to adopt `libcst` as the bundler for producing the single-file `serger.py`.  
It generates a deterministic, clean, human-readable script with none of the parsing fragility of the hand-rolled merger, and without the runtime import machinery of `pybundler`.

### Consequences

- The single-file build becomes **maintainable and robust**.  
- The **PyPI module** remains the canonical importable form.  
- `.pyz` and similar formats can be layered on later with minimal change.
- Developers can still open, diff, and audit the bundled file easily.

## Adopt a Three-Tier Distribution Strategy<small> — 2025-10-13</small>

### Context 

We want to reach as many people as possible and meet them where they are. 

We started with a simple stand-alone script, then as it grew more complex we made it a module to make maintenance and testing easier, but retained a stand-alone script via a hand-rolled merger script.

This decision formalizes how *serger* will be distributed and supported going forward.

---

### Options Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Tools
|--------|------|------|------|
| **PyPI module (default)** | ✅ Easy to maintain<br>✅ Easy for Python projects to install<br>✅ Supports imports and APIs | ❌ Requires installation and internet<br>❌ Not easily portable | [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/), [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) |
| **Single-file script** | ✅ Easy to distribute<br>✅ No install step<br>✅ Human-readable code<br>✅ Ideal for local and ad-hoc usage | ❌ Not meant for import<br>❌ Intended for CLI use only<br>❌ Merger can be hard to use and maintain<br>❌ Hard to read long source code | [`pinliner`](https://pypi.org/project/pinliner/) |
| **Zipped module (`.pyz`)** | ✅ Bundles everything into a single executable archive<br>✅ Maintains import semantics<br>✅ Excellent for CI/CD or air-gapped usage | ❌ Binary-like (unzip for source)<br>❌ Slight startup overhead | [`zipapp`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html), [`shiv`](https://pypi.org/project/shiv/), [`pex`](https://pypi.org/project/pex/) |
| **Native-like Executable bundlers** | ✅ Portable binary-like form<br>✅ Excellent for deployment<br>✅ No Python environment required<br>✅Unaffected by Python environment changes | ❌ Binaries themselves are not cross-platform<br>❌ Slight startup overhead<br>❌ Not source-level transparent<br>❌ May be overkill for CLI  | [`PyInstaller`](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/), [`shiv`](https://pypi.org/project/shiv/), [`pex`](https://pypi.org/project/pex/) |

---

### Decision

Adopt a **three-tier distribution model**:

1. **PyPI package** — the canonical importable module with semver guarantees.  
2. **Zipped module (`.pyz`)** — optional in future releases for CI/CD use. Easy to produce.
3. **Single-file script** — a `bin/serger.py` CLI built using `libcst`.  

Each tier serves a distinct user persona while sharing the same tested, modular codebase.

---

### Consequences

- The **source package (`src/serger`)** remains the authoritative code.  
- The **single-file build** gives end-users a portable, human-readable executable form.  
- A **future `.pyz` target** can provide hermetic portability for CI/CD without extra dependencies.  
- **PyInstaller**, **Shiv**, and **Pex** remain viable for downstream consumers who need binary-like distribution, but won’t be part of the core project.  
- This approach maintains transparency, reproducibility, and the “fits-in-your-pocket” philosophy while scaling to professional workflows.

# Template

## Title of Decision<small> — YYYY-MM-DD</small>

### Options Considered

- Option A — pros/cons
- Option B — pros/cons
- (Optional) Related discussions, experiments, or PRs

### Decision

# Example

## Example: Don't Auto-Update Headers on File Rename<small> — 2025-10-07</small>

### Context

Auto-updating header paths sounded useful but caused confusion when the header diverged from intentional naming (e.g. generated or aliased files).

### Options Considered

- ✅ Disable automatic updates by default
- 🔄 Enable by default with an opt-out
- ⚙️ Make it configurable

### Decision

Set `autoUpdate = false` by default.

### Consequences

- Simplifies mental model — users must explicitly choose to auto-update.
- Slightly less convenient for file renames, but avoids silent edits.
